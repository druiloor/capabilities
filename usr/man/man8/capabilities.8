[\fIcon(vert)|rev(ert)|list|help\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
capabilities
.PP
capabilities change the file system entry of binaries from using setuid\-0
to using POSIX Capabilities by granting the necessary Privileges
This is done by storing the needed POSIX Capabilities into the extended
attribute capability through setcap.
Following the idea of setuid - granting a binary the privilege regardless
of the user, the POSIX Capabilities are stored into the Permitted and
Effective set.
If you are using pam_cap.so, you might want to change the set into the
Inherited and Effective set (check for the SET var).
.PP
You need and I will check fot the utilities which, chmod and setcap.
.PP
Your Filesystem has to support extended attributes and your kernel must have
support for POSIX File Capabilities (CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES).
