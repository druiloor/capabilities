This is basically a simple form of shadow/unshadow kind of thingy for Linux CAPABILITIES(7)
Add to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.pcaps4suid0 ]; then
  if ! /etc/rc.d/rc.pcaps4suid0 start ; then
    echo "Error: /etc/rc.d/rc.pcaps4suid0 start" >&2
  fi
fi

And maybe a stop to rc.local_shutdown
